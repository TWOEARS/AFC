AFC SOFTWARE PACKAGE FOR MATHWORKS MATLAB 
=================================================

A. GENERAL PRODUCT DESCRIPTION.

AFC is a powerful Toolbox for Mathworks MATLAB. AFC is an entirely free configurable, 
alternative-forced choice procedure. The configuration of the procedure is highly flexible
and thus suited for development as well as research projects.
Stimulus generation and/or processing is digital using standard MATLAB commands. 
The Software does not require sophisticated hardware und programing knowledge.
All measurements are configurable using standard MATLAB scripting.
The signal output only requires a standard Windows sound device and is also working on 
transportable units like laptop computers.
The procedure also offers the possibility to invoke a MATLAB scripted model instead of a human
subject in order to retrieve responses. This allows the user to use exactly the same experiment
configuration and procedure in data collection and model simulations. 


B. BASIC FEATURES.

Free configurable n-Intervall m-Alernative-Forced Choice procedure
Adaptive transformed n-up m-down rule
Method of constant stimuli
Random and fixed presentation order
Interleaved parameter measurement
MATLAB-scripting for stimulus generation and processing, as well as for the response window
Interface to MATLAB scripted model (examples included)
No additional MATLAB toolboxes required

The Software is based on earlier versions of AFC/SIM/PSY developed since 1999 by Stephan Ewert.
AFC 0.93X and SIM 0.91 were partly developed while Stephan Ewert was working
in the Medizinische Physik at the Universiät Oldenburg, Germany.
PSY was developed while Stephan Ewert was visiting scientist at MIT, Cambridge, USA.
Major development steps where achieved while Stephan Ewert was at the Centre for Applied Hearing Research
at the Technical University of Denmark.
