Q: I changed expparX values in my experiment _cfg file, but it doesn't seem to be used when I
   run the experiment.
   
A: Once you start your experiment, AFC generates a control file (which is in the folder you
   specified with 'control_path' in _cfg or in the current folder (type 'pwd' in MATLAB) using
   the expparX values in the _cfg file. It has the name 'control_myexperiment_XYZ.dat'.
   If the control file is already existing, it is not overwritten. You have to delete it in order
   to let AFC generate a new one with the current values you specified in _cfg.

Q: Where are my data files?

A: You probably did not specify a 'results_path' in your experiment _cfg. In this case the
   results where written to your current working directory.

Q: I get the error:
	
	def.parrand dimension mismatch
	
A: def.parrand has to be a row vector with the number of elements equal to the number of exppars.

Q: I get the error:
	
	exppar dimension mismatch, incorrect number of tracks
	
A: One of your exppars has more than one but less columns than def.interleavenum.
   When interleaved, all exppars have to have def.interleavenum columns or only one column, in
   which case it is assumed that the specific exppar is the same for all interleaved tracks.

Q: I would like to have different startvars for the elements of expparN. Is it possible?

A: It is possible to use an additional exppar to define the startvars and to overwrite the values
   from def.startvar in the _set file of the experiment. The example experiment 'exampleInterleaved'
   documents how this is done. Please have a look at the 'exampleInterleaved_cfg.m' and 
   'exampleInterleaved_set.m' file.

Q: How do I set up the exppar variables for interleaved?

A: When running an interleaved experiment, the exppar variables which should be interleaved 
	in one run need to be in one column and def.interleavenum needs to equal the number of rows. 
	The exppars in different columns are used in different runs. The exppars in different rows are 
	used in the interleaved tracks of one run.

Q: The red highlighting of the buttons is not in sync with the sound. How can I tweak this?

A: Add def.marktIntervalDelay = 0 in autoexec_cfg.m and tweak the value. If you are using MATLAB 2007b a value of 0 fits.

Q: Why is AFC using global variables? I don’t like this and it confuses me.
	
A: The use of the global structures, e.g. work and def for AFCs internal communication has mainly historical reasons. 
	Back in 1999 it was the only way to let MATLAB do ‘pointer operations’ on the (back then) large sound data arrays 
	to enable fast enough processing for running AFC.
